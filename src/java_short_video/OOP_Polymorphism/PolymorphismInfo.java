    /*

    - ability of the objects to take on many forms
    - occurs when the reference type is parent class/interface and object type is child

    Reference Type      Object Type

    Animal animal1  =    new Dog();
    Animal animal2  =    new Dog();
    Animal animal3  =    new Dog();

    - Calling method in polymorphism :

        • Only the methods/variables in reference type can be called

        • When we call a method, it will call overridden version from a child class

        • If method is not overridden, it will call parent/super class version

     - Polymorphism Rules :

            • Reference type can be parent class or interface

            • Object type can be any extending or implementing child class

            • Reference type decides what is accessible

            • Object type decides which implementation of the method to
            be executed when the method is called



       - Intanceof Keyword :

           -Instanceof keyword can be used to check if the object is certain class. (Returns boolean)
