public class ExceptionHandling_TryCatch_Info {

    /*

    - to handle an exception (checked or unchecked), we can use try & catch blocks
    - it can be multiple catch blocks
    try{
        // ...
    }catch(Exception Class e){
        //....
    }

    Exception Object :

        -When runtime exception happens java will catch it and assigns to a variable in the catch block
        -After it is successfully caught, we can use the variable and call some methods on the exception object

        -Popular methods of exception objects are:

            printStackTrace(): prints a stack trace (full details) of the exception
            getMessage() : returns only brief description of the exception

      Finally Block :

        - An optional block that can be given after last catch block
        - Always executed after try & catch blocks whether an exception occurs or not
