    Creating Object:

        • Abstract class is meant to be inherited only,
        not meant to be instantiated

        • Abstract class is not a concrete class and
        object has to be concrete

        • A sub class of abstract class is called
        concrete class, and it can be instantiated

        • A Concrete class must implement all the
        inherited abstract methods




          Regular/ Concrete class

            can have constructors, instances and statics
            Regular class can be instantiated
            Regular class can not have abstract method
            Regular class can be declared as final

          Abstract class

            can have constructors, instances and statics
