    Exception :

        - an unwanted or an unexpected event
        - occurs during the compile time or during the runtime
        - there are two categories of exceptions: checked exception and unchecked exception
        - to prevent exceptions from crashing our program we must write code that detects and handles them

    Unchecked exceptions :

        - Exceptions that are not checked at compile time
        - occurs during the runtime
        - code will compile even if we do not handle them
        - they have IS A Relationship with RuntimeException (parent class of unchecked exceptions)

     Checked exceptions :

        -  Exceptions that are not checked at compile time
        -  occurs during the compile time
        -  code will not compile even if we do not handle them
        -  they do not have IS A Relationship with RuntimeException class
